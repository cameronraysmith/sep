abstract = {The world is increasingly populated with interactive agents distributed in space, real or abstract. These agents can be artificial, as in computing systems that manage and monitor traffic or health; or they can be natural, e.g. communicating humans, or biological cells. It is important to be able to model networks of agents in order to understand and optimize their behavior. Robin Milner describes in this book just such a model, by presenting a unified and rigorous structural theory, based on bigraphs, for systems of interacting agents. This theory is a bridge between the existing theories of concurrent processes and the aspirations for ubiquitous systems, whose enormous size challenges our understanding. The book is self-contained mathematically and is designed to be learned from: examples and exercises abound, solutions for the latter are provided.},

@article{Doering2008,
abstract = {The goal of this paper is to summarise the first steps in developing a fundamentally new way of constructing theories of physics. The motivation comes from a desire to address certain deep issues that arise when contemplating quantum theories of space and time. In doing so we provide a new answer to Heidegger's timeless question ``What is a thing?''. Our basic contention is that constructing a theory of physics is equivalent to finding a representation in a topos of a certain formal language that is attached to the system. Classical physics uses the topos of sets. Other theories involve a different topos. For the types of theory discussed in this paper, a key goal is to represent any physical quantity \$A\$ with an arrow \$\backslash breve\{A\}\_\backslash phi:\backslash Si\_\backslash phi\backslash map\backslash R\_\backslash phi\$ where \$\backslash Si\_\backslash phi\$ and \$\backslash R\_\backslash phi\$ are two special objects (the `state-object' and `quantity-value object') in the appropriate topos, \$\backslash tau\_\backslash phi\$. We discuss two different types of language that can be attached to a system, \$S\$. The first, \$\backslash PL\{S\}\$, is a propositional language; the second, \$\backslash L\{S\}\$, is a higher-order, typed language. Both languages provide deductive systems with an intuitionistic logic. With the aid of \$\backslash PL\{S\}\$ we expand and develop some of the earlier work (By CJI and collaborators.) on topos theory and quantum physics. A key step is a process we term `daseinisation' by which a projection operator is mapped to a sub-object of the spectral presheaf \$\backslash Sig\$--the topos quantum analogue of a classical state space. The topos concerned is \$\backslash SetH\{\}\$: the category of contravariant set-valued functors on the category (partially ordered set) \$\backslash V\{\}\$ of commutative sub-algebras of the algebra of bounded operators on the quantum Hilbert space \$\backslash Hi\$.},

abstract = {Questions that arose from linear programming and combinatorial optimization have been a driving force for modern polytope theory, such as the diameter questions motivated by the desire to understand the complexity of the simplex algorithm, or the need to study facets for use in cutting plane procedures. In addition, algorithms now provide the means to computationally study polytopes, to compute their parameters such as flag vectors, graphs and volumes, and to construct examples of large complexity. The papers of this volume thus display a wide panorama of connections of polytope theory with other fields. Areas such as discrete and computational geometry, linear and combinatorial optimization, and scientific computing have contributed a combination of questions, ideas, results, algorithms and, finally, computer programs.},
