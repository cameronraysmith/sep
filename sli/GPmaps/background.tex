\textbf{Hierarchy} is a fundamental organizing concept in biology. 
\end{block}
\begin{block}{}
The \textbf{existence} of a number of apparently \textbf{discrete levels} of organization including {\it molecules}, {\it cells}, {\it organisms}, {\it populations}, {\it communities}, {\it ecosystems}, and more fine-grained levels below, above and in between these are \textbf{taken for granted}. 
\end{block}
\begin{block}{}
\textbf{Theoretical constructs} capable of integrating information about such levels of organization and of explaining the emergence of such levels in the evolutionary process have \textbf{not} been \textbf{adapted} to a \textbf{biological context}.
