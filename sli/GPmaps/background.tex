An organism can be viewed as a collection of relatively coarse-grained \textbf{gene regulatory network modules} or relatively fine-grained \textbf{genes} that are interpreted into phenotypes.
\end{block}
\begin{block}{}
\textbf{Genotype-phenotype maps} can be evaluated at various levels of organization  beginning with a model of the gene and extending from complex molecular to ecosystem-level phenotypes.
\end{block}
\begin{block}{}
Repeated evaluation of the input-output dynamics of genotype-phenotype mappings on any given characteristic time-scale induces a \textbf{probability distribution over mappings} from \textbf{collections of genes} to \textbf{collections of phenotypes}. \textbf{Phenotypes} may be evaluated at any level, the level of evaluation determines the content of the collection of phenotype values.
