\begin{block}{make friends with an expert in category theory}
Have an expert review my manuscript on {\it Coherence constraints} that I have discussed today.
\end{block}
\begin{block}{implement graph transformations}
Work toward a computational implementation of a model of the evolution of network representations of biological systems using algebraic graph transformations while maintaining a clear semantic interpretation of the representations used in terms of the BioPAX ontology.
\end{block}
\begin{block}{finish manuscript on functional closure and metabolic networks}
Continue work on a second manuscript that builds upon the work of Robert Rosen to clarify the concept of functional (metabolic) closure and so-called intrinsic operationalism in metabolic networks.
