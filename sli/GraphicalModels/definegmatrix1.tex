For a cover of the genotype space, $\mathcal{G}$ associated to a graph, we can construct an incidence matrix, $\mathbf{G}$, representing the relationship between genotype-phenotype mappings having as domain particular GRNM contexts given by the $O \in \mathcal{G}$ and those global genotype-phenotype mappings defined on $L$.

\begin{block}{\textbf{Marginalization matrix associated to a graph}}
This is equivalent to the statement that there is some binary relation,
\begin{equation*}
R \subseteq \mathcal{E}(L) \times \coprod_{O \in \mathcal{G}} \mathcal{E}(O),
\end{equation*}
whose logical matrix representation, $\mathbf{G}$, we would like to construct.
