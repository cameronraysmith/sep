For the case in which we consider $R$ to be the semiring of non-negative real numbers $\left( \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0},+,0,\times,1 \right)$, $\mathcal{D}_R (L)$ represents the set of probability distributions on the set $L$.

We can consider the set of all (probability) distributions defined on the set $L$ as being given by a functor applied to $L$ as $\mathcal{D}_R (L)$. We can again explicitly represent the way in which the functor $\mathcal{D}_R$ acts on objects and morphisms $L$ and $f \colon L \rightarrow M$ as
