\begin{block}{\textbf{Collection of subsets of a set}}
We denote the set of all subsets of a set $X$ as $\mathcal{P}(X)$.
\end{block}
\begin{block}{\textbf{Space of all genotype-phenotype maps}}
$\mathcal{P}(L)$ can then be viewed as a category in which the objects are subsets of genes and morphisms represent inclusion of a smaller subset into a larger superset (i.e. $U \subseteq U' \Rightarrow U \rightarrow U'$).
\end{block}
\begin{block}{\textbf{Opposite category}}
The category $\mathcal{P}(L)^{opp}$ then has the same objects, but the morphisms represent restriction from a larger to a smaller subset of genes (i.e. $U' \supseteq U \Rightarrow U' \rightarrow U$).
\end{block}
