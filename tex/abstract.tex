It is commonly thought that a more complex genome can yield a higher diversity of phenotypes. This explanation is suggested to justify the evolution of complex organisms, as a broader range of phenotypes can obtain higher fitness in a wider range of environments~\cite{Adami2000,Carroll2001,Doebeli2010,Prochnik2010}. However, beginning with the highest resolution genotype to phenotype map, which we take to be gene expression, and using a formalism to reason generally about such maps~\cite{Lane1998,MacLane1992,Awodey2006,Abramsky2011}, we show that in a simple case where all possible gene regulatory interactions are allowed, the range of potentially accessible phenotypes is constrained. This conclusion is arrived at by directly comparing the volumes of the spaces of consistent probability distributions on genotype-phenotype maps for the case of a genome containing four simultaneously interacting genes to an identical genome constrained to interact in four different pairwise combinations. Surprisingly, we find that, in a mathematically precise sense, the latter space of probability distributions is larger than the former. A generalization of this result to an arbitrary number of genes implies that modularization of interactions within and among gene regulatory networks is a requirement to access additional correlations among the expression of multiple interacting genes that are intrinsically inaccessible when all possible interactions are allowed. The identification of \emph{regulatory constraint}~\cite{Bar-Even2006,Johnson2010a} as a necessary enabler, as opposed to an inhibitor, of \emph{phenotypic diversity} may contribute to a general explanation for the hierarchical and modular architecture~\cite{Ravasz2002,Segre2005,Wagner2007,Erwin2009,Bhardwaj2010,Colm} of the gene regulatory networks and, more generally, interactomes observed throughout the tree of life.
