Several broadly applicable features of gene regulatory networks have been identified and experimentally validated to a reasonable level of confidence in the past few decades. Among these features are 1. stochasticity in the transcription process and 2. hierarchical modularity in gene regulatory network architecture. In this study, we consider explanations for the interplay between these two important features in a semi-formal model that considers both the developmental and evolutionary processes. We demonstrate within the context of our stylized model that the space of all possible gene expression patterns should be considered relative to a gene regulatory network architecture. Furthermore, we present a method that can in principle quantify these relationships for gene regulatory networks of arbitrary topological structure. This recognition derives from and has important future implications for the development of a constraint-based approach to characterizing the coevolution of stochasticity and hierarchical modularity and to modeling evolutionary processes more generally.
