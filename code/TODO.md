## completed
1. Normalize colors and redraw fig 2
1. Approximate volume computation
1. Draw sublattice of hypergraphs on four vertices with cycles
    * [Graham reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraph#Acyclicity)
1. Recompute vol rat for sublattice of hypergraphs on four vertices with cycles
1. Make clustergrams from inference performed on inconsistent data
1. Draw lattice of hypergraphs on three vertices
    * Implement proper [antichain meet and join operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antichain#Join_and_meet_operations)
    * An antichain in the inclusion ordering of subsets of an n-element set is a Sperner family
    * [convert graphviz output to tikz](https://code.google.com/p/dot2tex/)
